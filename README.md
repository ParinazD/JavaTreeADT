# JavaTreeADT
uses ADT tree theory to sort movies by iMDB rating. Implements DFS and BFS

## Key Features
* **Custom Node Structure:** Flexible `Node<T>` supporting n-node child
* **Specialized Implementation:** `MovieRatingTree` handles movie objects and IMDb ratings
* **Traversal Algorithms:** Includes implementations of:
    * **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Pre-order traversal using a Stack/Deque.
    * **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Level-order traversal using a Queue.
* **Version History:** Git commits clearly show the development history, including the process of refactoring the traversal methods.
